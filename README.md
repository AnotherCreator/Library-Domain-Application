# Josh Reginaldo - ITMD 415
##Final Project Repo
This project helps us learn the basics of an MVC style approach using
JSP/Servlet, and to become familiar with these technologies in order to compare their use to later
frameworks.

This repo will be used for the current "Lab 3" assignment until the end of the semester.  
Commits will be prefixed with the appropriate title (e.g. [Lab 3]) to help distinguish between assignments

### Questions:
__Difference between the forward and redirect operations:__

__How would you be validating user submissions without the Bean Validation API
standard:__

__How do you think this approach would scale to a real application with 100's of
entities?__

__Why didn't we need to include any additional dependencies (i.e. Bean Validation,
JDBC) in this project?__
