# Josh Reginaldo - ITMD 415

This lab helps us learn the basics of an MVC style approach using
JSP/Servlet, and to become familiar with these technologies in order to compare their use to later
frameworks.

This repo will be used for the current "Lab 3" assignment until the end of the semester.  
Commits will be prefixed with the appropriate title (e.g. [Lab 3]) to help distinguish between assignments
