        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <h5>Library Application</h5>
        <ul><li>
            The goal of this project was to build a functioning Multi-layer Maven Web Application based off of a business domain
            of our choice. In my case, I have chosen to model a library domain.
            <br/>
            In this library domain, I focused on adding functionality to 3 main user groups: Admins, Employees, and Members.
            These are the three main entities that can freely interact with the web application based on their security
            clearance.
        </li></ul>
        <h5>Project Specifications</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>For basic CSS, I have included the necessary references for Bootstrap to work.</li>
            <li>I have also utilized the built in template functionality by JSF. In this project, referenced by
                the demos in the lectures, I have included the "ui:composition" tags and "ezcomp" templates when
                appropriate.</li>
            <li>In order to make navigation familiar and easy, I have also included the basic Bootstrap template for a
            fixed navigation pane at the top. Depending on user credentials, certain links may omitted.</li>
            <li>For member infomation stored in the database, employees and admins are able to read, create, update, and
            delete information stored in the database.</li>
            <li>The various information currently displayed on the website is also formatted in a list view.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Development Insights</h2>
        <h5>Things I Learned</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Security Aspect: Since this is my first interaction with implementing security, I opted to follow
                along with the structures demo'd in class. I found it quite enjoyable to see how the back-end is structured
                and the implementation of password hashing.</li>
            <li>Maven: I really enjoyed using Maven and learning how it can help streamline dependencies across
                different machines.</li>
            <li>Entity Relationships: Although I had an idea of how database entities can be related with the help of
            the database class, this project helped apply that knowledge into something that I can freely code and
            manipulate.</li>
            <li>Entity Constraints: Although I am familiar with data constraints, this is my first time seeing those
            constraints being added to the actual variable declaration and not manually checked later on.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>What I Liked / Disliked</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The thing I loved the most about this project was how unique it was, at least to me. This is the first
                project that I have done that asks of us to create a web domain modeling a business structure. The two main
                projects I have done so far are more of "mini" applications that can be modules of something more complex.
                <br/>
                I also enjoyed this project because it helps tie in the knowledge I have gained from the two web development
                courses I have taken so far. Although there was a significant syntax change while implementing JSF, it was
                largely the same. It also helped that we didn't have to do a lot of manual styling with the help of Boostrap.
            </li>
            <li>
                I did not have any "strong" dislikes that struck out to me. If there was one, it would probably be all
                the little quirks that IntelliJ had when following along the lectures. For example, the Bootstrap script
                tag in the .xhtml files show up as an error despite still working.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Final Thoughts</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Overall, I learned a lot from this semester and I definitely would like to work on this project in my
                free time.</li>
        </ul>
