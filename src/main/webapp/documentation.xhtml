        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <h5>Library Application</h5>
        <ul><li>
            The goal of this project was to build a functioning Multi-layer Maven Web Application based off of a business domain
            of our choice. In my case, I have chosen to model a library domain.
            <br/>
            In this library domain, I focused on adding functionality to 3 main user groups: Admins, Employees, and Members.
            These are the three main entities that can freely interact with the web application based on their security
            clearance.
        </li></ul>
        <h5>Project Specifications</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>For basic CSS, I have included the necessary references for Bootstrap to work.</li>
            <li>I have also utilized the built in template functionality by JSF. In this project, referenced by
                the demos in the lectures, I have included the "ui:composition" tags and "ezcomp" templates when
                appropriate.</li>
            <li>In order to make navigation familiar and easy, I have also included the basic Bootstrap template for a
            fixed navigation pane at the top. Depending on user credentials, certain links may omitted.</li>
            <li>For member infomation stored in the database, employees and admins are able to read, create, update, and
            delete information stored in the database.</li>
            <li>The various information currently displayed on the website is also formatted in a list view.</li>
        </ul>
